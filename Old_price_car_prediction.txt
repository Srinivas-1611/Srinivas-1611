This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning techniques.ðŸš—ðŸš“ðŸš™
Three regression models were employed: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Lasso Regression. 
The dataset underwent thorough preprocessing, including feature engineering and scaling. 
Each model was trained, evaluated using R-squared score, and compared through scatter plots visualizing actual versus predicted prices. 
This approach provides insight into the effectiveness of different regression techniques in forecasting car prices.
